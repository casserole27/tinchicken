### What I learned


### Continued development

- [Code review](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co32142e0a72507d39689ebb0)
   - saved profiles container should be populated inside main - not sure how to do that
   - buttons too large for mobile size 
   - use the cascade, don't separate hover / focus states - components in same location
   - chickensData - array of objects, can use the name as a key inside the object
   - map through each item, item.name, link variable with data
   - consistent indentation in Classes file
   - class file - return with a container around everything?
   - group event listeners, one listener on the document - possibly better performance
   - use filter method to find hasBeenSwiped to render next chicken
